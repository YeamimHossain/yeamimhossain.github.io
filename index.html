            <p class="section">Bio</p>
            <p class="par1">I am a prospective master/PhD student. I completed my B.Sc. in <a href="https://ete.ulab.edu.bd/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering (ETE)</a> at the <a href="https://ulab.edu.bd/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">University of Liberal Arts Bangladesh (ULAB)</a>, Dhaka, Bangladesh in summer 2019. During my B.Sc. thesis, I was supervised by <a href="https://eee.ulab.edu.bd/faculty/abul-barkat-mollah-sayeed-ud-doulah-phd" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Abul Barkat Mollah Sayeed Ud Doulah, PhD</a>.</p>
            <p class="par1">My research interests focus on machine learning, signal processing, biomedical signal analysis, deep learning, wireless communication and also embedded system. During my undergrad thesis, I gained knowledge in the field of machine learning, which drove my desire to publish conference proceedings in this area. I had worked on the detection of motor imagery EEG signals using machine learning techniques and also do a comparative analysis to find out the better performance using different ML algorithms. Both of these research works were published by the IEEE conferences. I am motivated to build my career in this field and develop myself by gathering knowledge and practical experience.</p>
            <p class="par1">Throughout my undergraduate studies, I honed my abilities in different programming languages (such as MATLAB, Python, and C programming), software and hardware skills, embedded systems (based on Arduino), etc. On the basis of my experiences and skills, I was appointed as Teaching Assistant (TA) at the Department of <a href="https://eee.ulab.edu.bd/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Electrical and Electronic Engineering (EEE)</a>, ULAB, Bangladesh. As a TA, my duties and responsibilities were to assist the faculty to conduct the lab classes, assist the faculty in preparing course materials, assist the faculty in maintaining course-related documents (lab report, assignment, document scrutinization), counsel students within my office hours, and invigilation duties sometimes.</p>
            <p class="par1">My hobby is reading novels, watching movies, playing video games, and traveling. Besides, I love to do research, build projects, coding and also designing. As a consequence, I actively participate in different contests and projects showcasing in my university life. Basically, I like to explore and experience new things. Above of all, I love to spend time with my family.</p>
