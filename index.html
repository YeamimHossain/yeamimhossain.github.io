            <p class="section">Bio</p>
            <p class="par1">I am a prospective master/PhD student. I completed my B.Sc. in Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering (ETE) at the <a href="https://ulab.edu.bd/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">University of Liberal Arts Bangladesh (ULAB)</a>, Dhaka, Bangladesh in summer 2019. During my B.Sc. thesis, I was supervised by <a href="https://ulab.edu.bd/academics/faculty-list/profile/239/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dr. Abul Barkat Mollah Sayeed Ud Doulah</a>.</p>
            <p class="par1">I have experienced in the machine learning field during my undergrad thesis, which further fueled me to publish conference proceedings in this field. My research interests focus on machine learning, signal processing, biomedical signal analysis, deep learning, and also embedded system. I had worked on the detection of motor imagery EEG signals using machine learning techniques and also do a comparative analysis to find out the better performance using different ML algorithms. Both of these research works were published by the IEEE conferences. I am motivated to build my career in this field and develop myself by gathering knowledge and practical experience.</p>
            <p class="par1">In my last semester of B.Sc., I was appointed as a part-time Teaching Assistant (TA) at the Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering (EEE), ULAB, Bangladesh. After my graduation, I was appointed as a full-time Teaching Assistant (TA) in the same department of the university. As a TA, my duties and responsibilities were to assist the faculty to conduct the lab classes, assist the faculty in preparing course materials, assist the faculty in maintaining course-related documents (lab report, assignment, document scrutinization), counsel students within my office hours, and invigilation duties sometimes.</p>
            <p class="par1">My hobby is reading novels, watching movies, playing video games, and traveling. Besides, I love to do research, build projects, coding and also designing. As a consequence, I actively participate in different contests and projects showcasing in my university life. Basically, I like to explore and experience new things. Above of all, I love to spend time with my family.</p>
